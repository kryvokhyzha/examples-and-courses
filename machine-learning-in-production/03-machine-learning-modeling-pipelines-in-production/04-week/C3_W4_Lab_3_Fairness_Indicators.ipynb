        "*   For the purposes of this notebook, the feature containing the `Young` attribute is referred to as \"age group\". A `True` will put the image as a member of the `Young` age group and a `False` will put the image as a member of the `Not Young` age group. These are assumptions made as this information is not mentioned in the [original paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/html/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.html).\n",
        "*   As such, performance in the models trained in this notebook is tied to the ways the attributes have been operationalized and annotated by the authors of CelebA.\n",
