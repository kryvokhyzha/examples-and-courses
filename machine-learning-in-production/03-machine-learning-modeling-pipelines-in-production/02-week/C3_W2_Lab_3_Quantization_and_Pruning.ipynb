        "In this notebook, you practiced several techniques in optimizing your models for mobile and embedded applications. You used quantization to reduce floating point representations into integer, then used pruning to make the weights sparse for efficient model compression. These make your models lightweight for efficient transport and storage without sacrificing model accuracy. Try this in your own models and see what performance you get. For more information, here are a few other resources:\n",
