    "# Adaptive Query Execution for Skewed Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewed data sets are a big issue, especially for join operations. Before Spark 3, it was difficult to optimize such situations, which could easily end up either in very long running jobs where only a single task dominates the overall runtime or even in OOMs. In order to cope with such situations, people increased the number of Spark partitions via `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` or salted the join keys (i.e. added random bits). While the first approach will affect all Spark operations, the second one is complex to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily with Spark 3 the situation improved a lot, thanks to the new AQE (Adaptive Query Execution). This Spark internal framework allows Spark to dynamically change the execution plan of a query once some parts are executed and additional information is available to the query planner. And this framework provides support for skewed joins, in which case it will automatically split up huge partitions into smaller ones and still correctly execute the join operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look how this works. This notebook is heavily influenced by [a Medium article by Mario Cartia](https://medium.com/agile-lab-engineering/spark-3-0-first-hands-on-approach-with-adaptive-query-execution-part-3-ea6012a8f216)"
