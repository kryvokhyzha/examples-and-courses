    "# Pandas UDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Normal\" Python UDFs are pretty expensive (in terms of execution time), since for every record the following steps need to be performed:\n",
    "* record is serialized inside JVM\n",
    "* record is sent to an external Python process\n",
    "* record is deserialized inside Python\n",
    "* record is Processed in Python\n",
    "* result is serialized in Python\n",
    "* result is sent back to JVM\n",
    "* result is deserialized and stored inside result DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not only sound like a lot of work, it actually is. Therefore Python UDFs are a magnitude slower than native UDFs written in Scala or Java, which run directly inside the JVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since Spark 2.3 an alternative approach is available for defining Python UDFs with so called *Pandas UDFs*. Pandas is a commonly used Python framework which also offers DataFrames (but Pandas DataFrames, not Spark DataFrames). Spark 2.3 now can convert inside the JVM a Spark DataFrame into a shareable memory buffer by using a library called *Arrow*. Python then can also treat this memory buffer as a Pandas DataFrame and can directly work on this shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has two major advantages:\n",
    "* No need for serialization and deserialization, since data is shared directly in memory between the JVM and Python\n",
    "* Pandas has lots of very efficient implementations in C for many functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these two facts, Pandas UDFs are much faster and should be preferred over traditional Python UDFs whenever possible."

    "We saw a couple of different Pandas UDF types, now the confusion starts when to use what. Actually most of the variants provide an interface that already imply their use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalar UDF** This is the simplest form of a Pandas UDF and is used to transform one or multiple columns into a new (possibly nested) column. Each invocation of the Python code itself will receive a small subset of the whole data and is required to return the same number of rows. The UDF can be called at all places where a Spark function can be called (i.e. in `select`, `filter`, `withColumn` etc).\n",
    "* **Map UDF** This form provides more flexibility than the scalar UDF, since the UDF will receive all columns from the Spark DataFrame. Each invocation will again receive a small subset of all rows, but with all columns. The UDF may return a Pandas DataFrame with a fixed set of columns but with a dynamic number of rows (i.e. it may return more or less rows than the incoming Pandas DataFrame). The Map UDF is used with the special PySpark method `mapInPandas`\n",
    "* **Grouped Map UDF** This UDF is very powerful and can be used as a wide aggregate function in a `GROUP BY` transformation. Eeach invocation of the Python function will receive the full set of columns and the full set of rows belonging to one specific group. The function may again return a DataFrame with an arbitrary number of rows and is used with the special PySpark function `applyInPandas`.\n",
    "* **Aggregation UDF** Finally PySpark also provides a simpler way for aggregating data than the grouped map UDF. The aggregation UDF has to return a single value (as opposed to a DataFrame with potentially multiple rows) and can be used whenever a Spark aggregate function (like `sum`, `avg`, ...) can be used.\n"
